# Introduction
Care Anatomy is the mental health care website that provides services for people who need support with their mental health or want to understand more about their mental health well-being. This online service is free of charge, but customers can pay a premium to get additional and special treatment. Also, there is a donation system on the website that allows people to donate money for the benefit of the project and people with mental health illness. Since we are in the pandemic (COVID-19), we will have special service available during the tough time.

# Magic.link Integration
1. We used the magic.link APIs to make our passwordless login page because we promot anonymity and safety which Magic links succeed in providing.
2. We also used the Magic+Stripe API to make an interface where the user can but our premium packs via stripe payment.

# FYI
We run the group chat using the local hosting. We cannot run the XAMPP application on the Nelify hosting server. So, we used ngrok to temporarily host the local host applications like care-rooms and login/sign-up page publicly.
